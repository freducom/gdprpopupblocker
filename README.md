# GDPR Popup and chatbot blocker extension for Chrome

## Why?

90% of websurfing today is shutting down popups that get in the way of the content you're looking for and is writter by lawyers that hate the internet.

## What?

This Chrome extension removes the DOM elements from the websites you visit, based on a blacklisted list of ids and classes.

## How to help?

1. Install it by downloading and adding as a chrome extension
2. Add more ids and classes to the content.js file and commit back to this repo
3. Share this in twitter and your social media

## Legal terms

This and everything else is Apache 2 licensed, use however you want to. Any illegal usage of this is on your own conscience and wallet – I take no responsibility for anything you do. If you've read this far you're unusually interested in legal terms and this extension is probably not for you. Get a life.
